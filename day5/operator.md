<!-- subtitle:  Understanding the basics of Logic Not Math behind the boolean Algebra-->

# Gorege Boole tossed the concept of Boolean Algebra
and said one can represent any logic with **AND, OR, NOT**

# Basic Logic is in their name
## Starting with `AND`
assume **AND** as 5 year old child who demand **telescope and Starship**, so if you provide him with those both stuff he will be happy, and if any one or both aren't their the child will start crying.

Similar with **AND** if it say I want value `x > 3 & y < 5` then the condition will only satisfy if **both** stuff are **true**

## Moving towards `OR`
same child here also, where now he demand **Falcon 9** **OR** **Saturn 5** as he wants to Mars. So, if you provide him **Falcon 9** he will be happy as his Mission will be completed with **Falcon 9**, but show you aren't able to contact **Elon** to arrange **Falcon 9** but you able to contact **NASA** for **Saturn 5** even then the 5 yr Child will be happy. Also, if you provided him with both **Falcon 9** and **Saturn 5** he will happy as now he can talk he crew too.

Similar, with **OR**, if it want `Falcon 9 || Saturn 5` if it get **Falcon 9** it will be satisfied even if it got **Saturn 5** it will satisfy, but it won't satisfy if both are **False**
