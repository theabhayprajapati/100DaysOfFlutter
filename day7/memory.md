# Memory and Stoarge in electronics

Electronics have two main types of memory Main and secondary.

Primary use of **Main(Primary) Memory**
<img src="https://img.icons8.com/plasticine/100/000000/computer-ram.png"/>
 is to store the data of task👨🏾‍🏭 that is working currently, as Main memory is very close to **CPU(Processor)** 🖥, to CPU can talk to Main memory very easily, this could be anything the tab us are currently open, webpage, cursor, the variable that you have wrote these all are stored in **RAM**,

but even you when you ***close*** you know when you close the tab, or programme if you ***havn't save📁*** that data, it will be **lost❌**.

so this should be saved some where some where else, and when you open the tab again, it will be there, here Storage, comes in to play you can store you data in any device, **Floppy💾**, **Hard Disk Drive**💽, **SSD🖴** and **USB🔌**, also it can be on **Cloud☁️**, it totally depends on you **the user**.

Use of **Secondary Memory**

as talk above **Secondary** have of *different type* but the function is same to **store permanently✅**.
from **operating system🐧**, **application📱**, and other files📂.

# Main memory

It offer very **fast read/write speed** but less storage capacity, it requires power supply and as power goes it losses it's data.

1. **RAM**
2. **ROM**
3. **Cache(cash)**

are in Main memory.

## RAM

![RAM Stick](https://img.icons8.com/plasticine/100/000000/computer-ram.png)
any thing runs has to **loads** on the **RAM** as **CPU** can process that fast, and also any location(data) can be **access** by **CPU** in no time(**instantly**), so it is called as **Random Access Memory**, it is **read/write** speed.

the code you write; and when you run it; it run's here, **Stack** the famous word in **CS** which I don't understand at begining, makes it's house inside the **RAM**.

## ROM

Rom is directly write for you from the manufactuer, it is **read only**, so it is called as **Read Only Memory**
the basic function is to start the applications' controll the Input/Output devices, and also to start the **OS**.

As,you dont' need to config these stuff they are **read only**, which means you and your computer can read from those files.

## Cache

it store the **command👆🏾** that are **frequently** told to the processor(**CPU**), so it is called as **Cache Memory**. It is quickest to access with least storage capacity

# Secondary Storage (Memory)

it offer **read/write speed** and **storage capacity**, but it is **not fast** to access as comapared to Main memory(**RAM**), not dependent on power you can access you even if power goes,**1000X** or times. think na you have turn your **computer** off📴 does it losses it's **operating system🐧** memory, you saved **files**📂, and you can access them again, also you can 🚌 from one device to another, and **access** there

There are two types of Secondary memory, **Optical Dics💿**, **Floppy Disk💾**, **SSD**🖴, **HDD(hard disk drives)💽**.

And these are the **storage devices** great storage capacity, it has mutilple faces

----------
these all I knew about memory and storage, and that i wanted to share, if you want learn memory I would recommend you to read the article from [@Issac_Computer_Science](https://isaaccomputerscience.org/topics/memory_and_storage?examBoard=all&stage=all)
